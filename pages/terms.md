## Reminder and terms of use

- THIS IS NOT A PAID SERVICE. Donations ARE NOT payment for our services. We use the money to pay for our web services, infrastructure and so on. This is one of the main reasons we are still keeping the playlist public, as we are not spending money to make profit, but to help others enjoy free TV!
- We only provide a stable TV channels playlist, not any other IPTV app/add-ons. You have to use a compatible IPTV player to load the playlist.   Our recommendations are Tivimate, TVirl or PVR IPTV add-on in Kodi.
- The streams in our playlist come from the TV channels live streaming themselves. We do not restream or host any streams at our infrastructure.
- We are not in a position to ensure 100% uptime of the streams, but the streams from the TV channels are always updated hourly to ensure they do not expire. If your streams are down please make sure your IPTV player updates the playlist. There can be also cases where the sources are down  which we have no control to fix.
- We do not recommed using modded APKs to load our playlist as they might not work. Support the original developers who have put in a lot of hours behind their work.
